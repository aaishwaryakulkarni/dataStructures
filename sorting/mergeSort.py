"""
Merge Sort Algorithm

Approach:

Divide and Conquer

Split array in 2 equal halves.
Call merge function on both halves
Keep doing this till all elements are covered

for each left and right halves, check which element is smaller and 
add that to the list.

At a point one list will still remain to iterate completely.
Add all elements to the nlist
